# the demonnic MDK and You

This is a collection of lua modules I wrote which you can include in your Mudlet package. If your package is called MyPackage, and the files it installs with it live in `getMudletHomeDir() .. "/MyPackage"`, and ftext.lua is in that base MyPackage directory, then you can include ftext by simply doing
```lua
local fText = require("MyPackage.ftext")
```

# documentation

Starting with alpha2 of the MDK, I will be including the ldocs I generate from my code in the zipped releases. The current release's ldocs can always be viewed at https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/

# list of files
These files contain the modules in the MDK. You only need to include those files which you intend to use, except as noted in the descriptions below. If you include any of the modules from the MDK, you should also include LICENSE.lua. It contains the licenses for my modules and for luaunit and lua-schema which are not my original works.
